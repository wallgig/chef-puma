# The following variables are set by Runit:
#
# EXIT_CODE: ./run's exit code
#
# EXIT_STATUS: The least significant byte of the exit status as determined by
#  waitpid(2); for instance it is 0 if ./run exited normally, and the signal
#  number if ./run was terminated by a signal.
#
# The following configuration variables must be set:
#
# MIN_AUTO_RESTART_INTERVAL: The minimum delay (in seconds) between automatic restarts
#
# MAX_AUTO_RESTART_COUNT: The maximum number of automatic restarts allowed
#
# AUTO_RESTART_COUNT_CLEAR_INTERVAL: Reset the restart count if
#  AUTO_RESTART_COUNT_CLEAR_INTERVAL seconds have elapsed since the last
#  automatic restart.
#
# Creates two new files in the service directory:
#
#   last_finish - the Unix time (seconds since 1970) when the ./finish script
#                 last ran
#
#   restart_count - the number of automatic restarts that have taken place
#
# These files must be removed BEFORE the service is cleanly shut down.

# ./run was terminated by a signal.

# have elapsed since the last automatic restart.
